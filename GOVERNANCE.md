# Contributor Roles

## Developer
Do you know RHEL? Can you code in Ansible? You could consider being a developer for this project.

**Examples of contributions**

- GitLab: Submitting a merge request.
- GitLab: Peer reviewing code.
- GitLab: Updating documentation or fixing typos.
- Mentoring other developers.

**Responsibilities**
Our availabilities are always changing. If work comes up, which means limited capacity to fulfill a task, unassign yourself from that task to free it up for another developer.

## Designer
Design is the intersection of engineering, business, and art. While this project needs developers to build the product, it also requires designers to engage stakeholders to ensure that we are on the right track to deliver a product that will solve our problem effectively. 

**Examples of contributions**

- Working with service delivery managers to align the project with business requirements.
- Working with other consultants to conduct research on problem areas, and co-create solutions which can feed back into development.
- Review user friendliness of the solution.
- Review artefacts such as README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md to ensure their effectiveness in promoting open source culture.
